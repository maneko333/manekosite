    <p>hiii i'm devin or maneko, either is fine!</p>
    <p>i'm <em>29 years old</em> and grew up on the old web and miss it dearly
      everyday. i'm so happy that there is a kind of .... resurgence in this diy web!</p>
    <p>i have a lot of different hobbies and interests so it can be tough for me to focus sometimes. i also am a
      <em> video game hopper</em>. anytime i start a game i quickly get distracted by a new
      release.
      i have a large steam
      library but have not completed many of them. (*/ω＼)
    </p>
    <p><em>i really love</em> and am passionate about <em>music</em>. right now
      i'm really into porter
      robinson, but i have lots of
      favorites from all different genres. i love lyrics and analyzing them. i wish i could create my own music
      someday!!</p>
    <p>i'm working on this site in my spare time in-between my full time job
      and other hobbies so development has been kind of slow.. oops. (￣ω￣;)</p>
    <p><em>thank you</em> for stopping by and look forward to more content soon!</p>
