          I finally was able to do something that I never ever thought I'd be able to do. <em>I finally got to see My
            Chemical
            Romance
            live!!!!</em> I have been waiting 20 years to see them and honestly lost hope that I ever would. It's
          actually
          crazy
          and
          insane because I've loved them for so so so long...
        </p>

        <p>
          Rewinding back,
          I still remember the first time I had ever saw/heard them.. I was 9 years old and watching
          MTV. They used to play a lot of alternative stuff back then... back when they actually played music
          videos
          in
          the
          first place. I remember the first video from them I had ever seen was “Helena”, of course. As dramatic as this
          sounds, I
          was so mesmerized by this video. I remember just standing still and watching. I've always been (and still am)
          a
          pacer. I
          will move or walk back and forth across my living room obsessively while watching TV or playing music or
          singing.
          Sometimes I'll just stand in place and rock on my heels. This time though, I just remembber standing still and
          watching.
          I'm sure my mouth was probably open. I was just fascinated by everything. The outfits, the mood, the dancer,
          that
          FUCKING rainy umbrella scene that lives in my mind forever...</p>

        <p>Man... when I tell you....
          when I saw Gerard
          Way
          for
          the first time, I was floored. Something inside me definitely awakened and I just was so enamoured with him.
          In
          the most
          innocently and unknowingly parasocial way possible ((I was nine years old and hormones were definitely
          surging))... we
          didn't even really use the (now overused) term 'parasocial' back then. I fell in love with him. To this day,
          and
          probably forever, he will be my biggest and most influential (and memorable) celebrity crush ever. You
          couldn't
          tell me
          ANYTHING back then. All I talked about was Gerard (and Mikey sometimes... I guess depending on the day lol). I
          swore I
          was going to marry him someday. Again, I was nine years old so this, of course, was just silly little kid
          stuff.
          ((oooookay maaaaaybe early teens me thought the same thing...))
        </p>

        <p>
          Obviosuly My Chem became my entire midde school personality. But I guess for good reason. I was not a popular
          kid
          in
          middle school. In fact, I was quiiite on the opposite spectrum. I was that one girl that was the last to be
          picked
          for
          everything and oh MAN if a boy found out that I had a crush on them, they'd actually be MAD... as if I had
          done
          something wrong for simply existing. I remember doing a school project that involved some video editing and I
          had
          put
          quite a lot of effort into it becase it was genuinely something I enjoyed... I always spent lots of time doing
          hobbies
          and listening to music. One of the more popular girls decided that ME choosing to work on a project offended
          her
          for
          some reason and called me a loser for putting so much effort into it. She said that I should go outside
          because
          WHO
          would EVER want to work on homework rather than do something fun. This happened a lot. and it happened for
          EVERYTHING. I
          remember I developed a complex because the one boy I had a crush on said that I had big ears while my hair was
          in
          a
          ponytail. I never wore my hair up again until I was maybe 19 years old and tried spacebuns for the first time.
          A
          few
          years later, a new kid came to school and I had liked him. Of course, I was already at a disadvantage since
          apparently I
          was an ugly loser monster. One of the girls told him that I was a creepy stalker and made up all these crazy
          lies
          to get
          him to not wanna talk to me. Why even do that? Why did I bother you so much? At this point, I was borderline
          suicidal
          and also just riddled with anxiety.</p>

        <p>I tried bringing it up to my doctor but was just met with, “Pull up your
          big
          girl
          pants and deal with it.” Looking back now... I think a lot of things in my life could've been prevented if I
          had
          just
          gotten help back then. But sadly, I was doomed to be the weird anime music emo girl.. ((back then anime
          definitely
          wasn't as popular as it is today.. .at least not in my school...)). All of this isn't to say that didn't have
          some
          friends.. I even had one that had similar interests as me!! But, kids change so fast so my friendships never
          really
          seemed to last long. As sad as it is, I can't say that I have a lifelong childhood friend. ((I actually didn't
          meet my
          real friends until I was around 21 at my first job.)) <em>I just never felt like I truly belonged
            anywhere</em> and
          especially
          not in my school or neighborhood/community. For living in a big city, the neighborhood I grew up in was small
          and
          crazy
          close-knit. There's definitely a vibe of.. you follow in the footsteps of your parents, you don't do anything
          different,
          go anywhere new.. You marry someone from the neighborhood, stay close, etc. There were a few of us “outcasts”
          that
          stuck
          together outside of school ,and I am grateful for the few that hung out with me while it lasted, of course.
          Anyway... so
          when I saw the music video for “I'm Not Okay”, I honestly had never felt so seen in my young life. Obviously
          it's
          fiction, but I mean... the band themselves have said that they related to that video in one way or another. If
          you've
          never seen it, I suggest that you give it a quick watch, it's good and kinda funny too. But... me being in
          catholic
          school and being the odd one out, I most definitely related to the band portraying the misfits in a
          prestigious
          prep
          school. It was then that I just would play the music videos over and over and over on the TV using OnDemand
          and
          MusicChoice (hell yeah if you remember that). My poor mom knows these songs word for word basically.
        </p>

        <p>
          I needed their album but my mom kinda felt weird buying it because of the blood and all on the cover. So for a
          Christmas
          gift/secret santa type thing, I remember begging this one girl who I had kind of been off-and-on friends with
          for
          My
          Chem's album “Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge” and I had gotten her Jesse McCartney's album. I had never been
          so
          happy. I
          ripped it open and studied the lyric booklet front to back as I listened to the cd on my blue Sony cd player.
          I
          listened
          to it start to finish SO many times (it didn't have a shuffle function anyway hah.) I would listen to it and
          read
          the
          lyrics as I went. I'd analyze everything. I still remember the track order, to this day. I remember “Cemetary
          Drive”
          being one of my favorites. There was just something about it i can't describe.. I made My Chem ((and so many
          other
          bands)) my entire personality.. because for once it finally felt like other people knew what I was going
          through
          and how
          I felt. Growing up, my parents were definitely in the “in-crowd” of their peers, so I felt like I could never
          really
          talk to them about this.. after hearing so many stories of the things they did and the way they were
          portrayed.
          I
          guess
          I was just scared of being seen as a loser. So it was around this time I started developing my first
          hyperfixations and
          my experiences with escapism.
        </p>

          Skip forward to The Black Parade coming out a few years later. When I saw Gerard with the blonde short cut, I
          was
          a bit
          shocked and kinda sad at first because I LOVED his dark hair and red makeup. BUT, it grew on me... probably
          because I
          just liked *him* a whole lot. I remember liking the album and it also turning into a heavy rotation in my beat
          up
          blue
          cd player... “Disenchanted” was my favorite song on that album. This is around the time I also discovered
          their
          very
          FIRST album, “I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love”. That quickly became my favorite album,
          alongside
          Three Cheers still holding the second place spot. I remember though, loving Black Parade at this time... and
          getting
          into an argument with one of the more popular girls in my class (surprise, the one I mentioned prior). She
          messaged me
          on AIM ((I miss AIM, damn)) and said that My Chem was funeral music. I remember quoting the lines from the
          song
          and
          saying it's quite the opposite... it's about LIVING!!!! It's about living despite EVERYTHING ELSE!!! and then
          I
          insulted
          her for liking One Direction... definitely middle school stuff. Either way, for some reason that's a
          conversation
          that
          sticks with me to this day... I just remember thinking like... “am I crazy?” “Why does no one else get it? Do
          they
          not
          hear the same thing I hear?” Was this why I was a loser? Did I overanalyze too much? Or was I a loser because
          I
          invested
          so much of my time and energy in things that weren't tangible in my real life. This band did not know me.
          Their
          music
          was just... music. So why was I so invested in them... in ALL of the music I listened to at the time?
          (spoiler:
          I
          am
          still like this). Regardless, I carried their (and a few other bands'!!) music with me through many more
          stages
          of
          my
          life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Actually... I thought I'd never get to see them live because honestly, I didn't think I'd make it this far. I
          truly
          didn't even have a plan for making it past 15. And then I did. And then things sucked again for a while... and
          then I
          didn't think I'd make it past 20. But I did. And I'm still here. And I'm still a bit paralyzed. Because I
          don't
          know
          what I'm doing... I don't know what to do or where to go from here. I have no plans.. I just kind of exist day
          to
          day. I
          always dreamed of being a musician. I've always said and still say... “I hope in my next life, I am a
          performer
          on
          stage. I hope I'm in a band. I hope I can make music.” Things are better for me now. But I still have that
          paralyisis.
          This crippling fear of rejection and perfectionism. I truly DO hope that I can make music some day. But for
          now,
          I
          just
          exist... and that's further than I ever thought I'd be.
        </p>

        <p><em>I digress.</em></p>

        <p>
          When tickets went on sale a few months ago.. I remember shaking. My heart had never beat so fast in my entire
          life.
          Somehow... I was placed #777 in the online queue... and I got them. I got pit tickets... and...I was able to
          see
          them.
          Two days ago. When they walked onto the stage and I saw Gerard.. I sobbed. I cried so hard. (I'm actually
          crying
          right
          now as I type this sentence too, haha.) (Just came back to proofread and cried again.) I became SO
          emotional...
          because
          I was that 9 year old girl again... staring at the TV in awe. I cried for her and for everything I had ever
          felt.
          And I
          cried for ME. NOW. For still being here, despite everything. I was staring at this man... these guys who don't
          even know
          that they saved my life.. actually MANY people's lives.. a few times. And... they were so close to me. I could
          see
          their
          faces clearly with my own eyes!! ((I have very poor eyesight.)) I feel like many people in the crowd felt the
          same
          as
          me. I really do. I haven't been in a crowd like that in such a long time. I haven't been in a crowd where you
          felt
          the
          emotions of people singing EVERY song with all of their hearts. Where I wasn't afraid that if I took a quick
          video, my
          voice would drown out the rest of the scene. EVERYONE was singing along. </p>
        <p>There were these guys who started a
          mosh
          and we
          were all having so much fun. And then... during the more emotional songs, they stopped. We stopped and just...
          sang..
          together. I've been to concerts where the artist will sing a very slow and heartfelt song and people will just
          continue
          to talk or scream over it.. and I mean.. it's a concert so I get it, but sometimes it can be so
          disrespectful!!!
          But not
          here... everyone would get quiet and just sing along. It was so beautiful. It was one of the best crowds I
          have
          been in
          in such a long time. The show was amazing. They sounded amazing live.. I actually hadn't even thought about
          the
          fact
          that this was a live performance because they sounded straight off of the album! The performance and theater
          aspect was
          so incredible and thought-provoking as well. Mikey was great on his bass. Frankie was amazing on his guitar.
          Ray
          was
          incredible and so cool doing the solos. Gerard was so.... inspiring. All of the band was just... amazing. It
          was
          everything I had ever dreamed that it would be. They even played a song off of Bullets!! They played
          “Headfirst
          for
          Halos!” I was so surprised and happy!! And we were all screaming the lyrics along. I really feel like it
          healed
          such a
          huge, dark, part of me.
        </p>

        <p>
          But... on the flip side. I feel kind of.... lost again. I fulfilled such a huge stretch goal of my life. I
          never
          thought
          I would. So now I'm also stuck with this conflicting feeling of hollowness... of like... “what do I live for
          now,
          if not
          this?”
        </p>

        <p><em>I guess maybe I should pick up one of my instruments or something then.</em></p>
