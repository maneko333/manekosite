      <h4>*i will format this better later*</h4>

      <p>
        At the time I’m typing this, it’s a day late to the actual one
        year anniversary but sadly being an adult in today’s world has a
        way of wearing you down. This is also probably only going to be
        semi-coherent and probably cringe, since when I think about/talk
        about this album I get so excited and just kind of ramble.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyways, for a bit of backstory/context. I wasn’t introduced to
        Porter’s music until around 2016/2017 and I first heard Fresh
        Static Snow and the Worlds album. This song was such a game
        changer for me. It was a song that even still I hold so close to
        my heart since I’d never heard a song that put the exact type of
        yearning that I’ve felt into such perfect words. Like.. that
        mourning for someone you’ve never met and probably never will
        meet but would be that missing piece to your life. From then on,
        I followed Porter but remained a casual fan. When Nurture came
        out, I had stepped away from listening to music as much as I
        used to, which is funny because I attribute my very existence
        still remaining to music. I hadn’t listened to it much except
        for Get Your Wish, which quickly became my favorite song from
        him besides Fresh Static Snow. I mostly brushed it off, still
        primarily just being a Worlds fan. Looking back now, Nurture has
        become a special album to me as well, and I know if I had given
        it more of a chance at the time, it really could’ve helped with
        some of the things I was struggling with at the time. However,
        at that point in my life, there was pretty much just empty space
        and static in my mind.. I was mainly on autopilot since
        depression left room for nothing else. It wasn’t until hearing
        Cheerleader all these years later and reading the words and then
        getting into this album that I can say that Porter skyrocketed
        to being one of my favorite artists of all time.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve told people that Smile literally has changed my perspective
        on a lot of things. Growing up, around the age of 8 or 9, Fall
        Out Boy’s From Under the Cork Tree changed my adolescent life.
        The songs on that album carried me through so many things at
        that time. It was like my thoughts were laid out and put to
        paper thanks to amazing writing from Pete Wentz. It touched on
        so many topics relevant to me at that time. Imagine so many
        years later… Smile has given me that same feeling. This album
        has genuinely changed my adult life. I was 28 at the time and
        have now recently turned 29. Lately I had been feeling very….
        Lonely? Maybe that’s not the right word, since I’m surrounded by
        so many amazing friends and family. I guess it’s more like…I’m
        yearning for the past and the way things used to be, yet also
        yearning for the future that I had planned. I am tragically
        nostalgic and have been feeling very down about aging,
        insecurity, and generally just letting go and embracing things
        for what they are. I felt like all the fun had been had and that
        everything is all dried up since I was perceiving myself as
        “old”. So many songs on this album helped turn that around for
        me.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other reason this album is so special to me is because of
        the themes of parasocial fan/artist relationships. I have always
        been someone who felt very deeply when it came to music, and
        that hasn’t changed. I become kind of… attached to the artists
        in a way that can sometimes border parasocial, as embarrassing
        as that sounds writing it out.. However, even through the bits
        of poking fun, Porter portrays it as a beautiful thing as well.
        Everything to Me actually made me cry when I first heard it
        because it summed up every single feeling that I have always
        felt in relation to the artists that I love. And it felt so
        amazing hearing it from an artist’s standpoint of a
        reciprocation of this. I’ll go into more detail for each song so
        if you wanna stop here, then all I have to say is that Smile is
        genuinely one of my favorite albums of all time.. It has this
        nostalgic, fun, hyper, sincere feeling to it that is so
        contagious and addicting. I have listened to this album so many
        times on repeat and I still am not even close to being tired of
        it. Usually new songs and albums take me a few listens to warm
        up to… but I fell in love with this album immediately. It
        reminded me of songs and styles I loved as a kid. It gave a
        fresh perspective on things. It felt like having fun with a
        friend. This may be my favorite album in the last 5 years and
        I’m so happy that it exists. You can feel the love and work that
        Porter put into it.
      </p>

        <em>Some quick thoughts on the songs and how they make me
          feel/how I interpret them.</em>
      </p>

      <h2>01. Knock Yourself Out XD</h2>
      <p>
        I think this is the song that I immediately thought “holy fuck,
        this is amazing.. they don’t make ‘em like this anymore.” The
        catchy lil melody is so fun and gets stuck in my head so easily.
        It brought me back to early 2000s little unknown MySpace scene
        kid bands I’d listen to. All those bands are mostly gone now,
        and if they are still around, they don’t have that same sound
        anymore. It felt SO good to hear something like this again.
      </p>

      <h2>02. Cheerleader</h2>
      <p>
        Reading this lyrics, hearing the song, seeing the video. I’ve
        never felt sooooo seen and a bit roasted in the most catchy and
        fun way. I just love so much about this song. It makes me feel
        like I’m speeding SO fast down like.. rainbow road or something.
        Just going super fast at the speed of light down some winding,
        neon flashing road. Also like… I’ll post a longer thought piece
        on this later but the whole “it’s not your fault you’re living
        in a madhouse” gets me because to MEEE it’s like, yes I’m
        obsessed with this musician because my life outside of the
        headphones is so lame and bad that I NEED to escape into this
        because no one else understands me this well. Bit of personal
        experience there.
      </p>

      <h2>03. Russian Roulette</h2>
      <p>
        THIS FUCKING SONG!!!!! Wasn’t expecting something like this at
        all. Especially when Porter lists all of the reasons he has to
        keep going. It was a nice little reminder of why we all keep
        going. Also the lil synth intro and breakdown after the chorus
        is actually INSANE and I need more songs with that sound.
        Everything about this album screams nostalgia to me and this
        song is noooo different.
      </p>

      <h2>04. Perfect Pinterest Garden</h2>
      <p>
        Probably one of my top favs on the album (I cannot rank formally
        because I love them all so much). There’s a lyric in this song
        that stands out to me SO much. “If you saw me, a stranger in the
        streets, could you tell me you love me? Maybe we should both
        make real friends.” I love this sooo much because it is a bit
        thought provoking. Like… if this artist wasn’t an artist.. would
        you still be interested in them? Would you still think they’re
        fascinating and someone you’d want to be friends with? Or is it
        just because you’re putting them on a pedestal? And the “maybe
        we should both make real friends” is great because, to me, it’s
        like… oh the artist is kind of addicted to this relationship
        too.
      </p>

      <h2>05. Year of the Cup</h2>
      <p>
        I won’t hear out ANY year of the cup slander. Even with the Lil
        Wayne samples..It’s so good. It’s sooo honest and it’s nice to
        hear artists be so open. I can tell Porter was being super
        vulnerable and sincere with this song. It’s like you can almost
        hear it in his voice. I also love that he calls his one excuse
        an irresponsible mantra. So many people think that saying “sorry
        I’m like this” will excuse them from ever changing their ways.
        This song is just such an amazing example of owning up to
        mistakes. (( also I wanna know the fully story behind ‘the bus
        went totally silent’ ))
      </p>

      <h2>06. Kitsune Maison Freestyle</h2>
      <p>
        This song is so fun but also relevant because damn I AM on a
        diet so I CANT eat that (I’m gonna anyway)). Soooooo many people
        are just drowning in insecurity and using money, brands,
        clothes, etc to cover that up. Insecurity, materialism.. a good
        topic to touch on. Plus I love the lil rapping part, it’s cute.
      </p>

      <h2>07. Easier to Love You</h2>
      <p>
        This one hits me hard. Feeling like I let younger me down.
        Feeling like I’ve let everyone down. It’s comforting to hear
        this shared experience from an artist I admire. Knowing Porter
        feels this way too made me cry because he wrote it so
        beautifully. Especially the “dear future me” part. This song
        feels so warm and yet like I’m watching my younger self walk
        home from school in the rain. I can’t explain that last line,
        but it is what it is. This is a song I needed to hear this
        (last?) year. I’ve been struggling with the nagging feeling that
        I’m not where I should be in life at my age and that I haven’t
        achieved anything that I thought I was going to when I was like,
        12 and that I let that version of me down.. But after hearing
        this song… it felt like I saw her, I talked to her, and she gave
        me a hug and said she was just happy to see I’m still here.
      </p>

      <h2>08. Mona Lisa</h2>
      <p>
        Another of my top favorites. I think of this song from the
        perspective of a lot of different scenarios. I like the way you
        do your makeup, it’s just sooooo sweet. Probably one of my fav
        lines on the album, just because.
      </p>

      <h2>09. Is There Really No Happiness?</h2>
      <p>
        SUCH A HEAVY HITTER FOR ME!!! This song encapsulates every
        single thing I’ve been feeling regarding nostalgia, missing the
        past, missing early 2000s technology, old web, playing with my
        friends, no cellphones. I miss it all so much. I miss when the
        internet was a CHOICE. Browsing websites was fun because you saw
        the creator’s personality… everything had personality back then.
        This song just feels like all of that bittersweetness was
        somehow put to a melody. Is there really no happiness left
        without those feelings? Also, “You know, Porter? Some people DIE
        of nostalgia…. So you better look out” is so good because
        sometimes I literally feel so depressed because of it, so this
        was a cute little part to put in.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Everything to Me</h2>
      <p>
        Finally… this tearjerker. I have a longer thought piece that I’m
        gonna share eventually on this song alone. This song may be one
        of my favorite songs of all time. It is rivaling “I’ve Got a
        Dark Alley..” by Fall Out Boy. Both songs have completely taken
        the feelings straight from my brain and heart and everything
        else and just laid them out on paper and then put them to a
        heart-wrenching melody. I’ve never heard a song describe
        fan/artist relationships like this one. It’s so truthful and raw
        from the artist perspective, but also the chorus could be
        doubled as a perspective from the fan as well. Hearing the “Get
        Your Wish” chorus on guitar in the middle of the song made me
        cry when I first heard it (and still makes me tear up a bit)
        because 1. It’s maybe my favorite song from Porter of all time
        and 2. Something about it gave me such a full-circle moment that
        I can’t really describe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I could go on and on about this album and what it means
        to me, but I’d really just be rambling and no one wants to sit
        through 20 more paragraphs. Plus, I feel like I can’t really
        arrange my thoughts how I’d like to so I wouldn’t do it justice
        anyway. I saw Porter live this past spring in Chicago and seeing
        him play pretty much every song off of every album was insane.
        It’s something I’ll remember forever and one of my favorite
        concerts I’ve been to.
      </p>

      <p>
        SMILE:D is such an amazing album. It’s fun, happy, sincere,
        emotional, crazy, loud, sad, nostalgic… so many more words that
        I can’t think of. Porter said that he feels like he’s at the
        bottom of the mountain and just getting started as an artist. If
        this is just him getting started, then I’m so excited to see
        what lays ahead and what he has in store for us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Porter, thanks for making this album and being so honest on it.
        Thanks for showing me that I’m not the only one having these
        struggles with the past and the future. Can’t wait for the next
        one.
